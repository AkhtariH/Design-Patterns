# Design Patterns: ToDo Application

## Description

The objective of this final assignment is to develop a Java application that incorporates at least three design patterns (Singleton and Iterator excluded). This application uses the Factory method pattern, Decorator pattern and the State pattern to create a simple console-based ToDo application where the user is able to create Lists and items within these lists. For more information about the application see the [documentation](#documentation).
